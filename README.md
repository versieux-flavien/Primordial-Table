# Primordial-Table

This project is for the implementation of an interactive rune.

    1:the interaction of the rune

The primary rune is divided into 76 segments that form the main geometric shape and 29 points that form the junctions between the segments.

Each segment and point is clickable by keeping the order of the clicks.

A button allows to validate the click sequence.

    2:use of recorded sequences

The sequence is displayed in a field for this purpose.

Multiple sequences can be stored in succession.

Each of these sequences is called rune and is classified according to 6 types.

In the area that receives the registered runes, the type of rune is displayed next to the corresponding rune.

    3:the language of runes

Each sequence of runes corresponds to a word and a succession of sounds.

The user can form words and phrases that he can save either as text, as a copy-paste, or as an image with runes and text below.

    4:from word to rune

A space is dedicated to writing either in their language or with the known sounds of runes.

When writing in oneâ€™s own language, an adjacent area allows the corresponding sounds to be visualized as well as the sequence of runes needed to form the word.

When you write the sounds, the adjacent area allows you to visualize the corresponding words and the sequence of runes necessary to form the sounds.
